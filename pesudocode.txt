1. Define constants:
    - MAX: Maximum length of strings
    - NUM_THREADS: Number of threads to use

2. Declare global variables:
    - total: Total count of matching substrings
    - n1, n2: Lengths of strings s1 and s2
    - s1, s2: Pointers to strings read from file
    - fp: File pointer
    - mutex: Mutex lock for thread synchronization

3. Define function prototype:
    - search_substring(void* arg): Thread function to search for substrings

4. Implement search_substring(void* arg) function:
    - Calculate end index based on start index and number of threads
    - Iterate over the assigned portion of s1:
        - For each substring of length n2:
            - Compare characters of s1 and s2
            - If all characters match, increment local count
            - Lock mutex before updating total count
            - Increment total count
            - Unlock mutex after updating total count
    - Exit thread

5. In the main program:
    - Declare variables:
        - threads[NUM_THREADS]: Array to hold thread IDs
        - thread_args[NUM_THREADS]: Array to hold start indices for each thread
    - Call readf(fp) to read strings from file
    - Create threads:
        - For each thread ID from 0 to NUM_THREADS-1:
            - Calculate start index for the thread
            - Create thread with search_substring function and start index as argument
    - Wait for threads to finish:
        - For each thread:
            - Wait for thread to finish using pthread_join
    - Output total count of matching substrings
    - Exit program
