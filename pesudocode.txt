1. Declare pthread_mutex_t mutex_lock

2. Modify producer_thread function:
    - Change the critical section handling:
        - Replace pthread_mutex_lock with pthread_mutex_trylock to attempt to acquire the mutex without blocking
        - Add a while loop to continuously attempt to access the critical region until the mutex is acquired

3. Modify main function:
    - Remove the declaration of int i and int NUM_PROCS; they are declared later in the code
    - Modify the initialization of the cpu_array:
        - Allocate memory for cpu_array based on the number of processors
        - Initialize cpu_array with processor IDs
    - Remove the redundant else statement after initializing cpu_array
